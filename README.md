<h1 align="center"> Mesa </h1>

<p align="center">
A modern, idiomatic web framework for <a href="https://github.com/leostera/riot">Riot</a>.
</p>

Mesa is a web development framework inspired by [Phoenix][phoenix]. It is
written in OCaml, for the  [Riot][riot]-runtime.

Mesa implements the server-side Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. Many of
its components and concepts will seem familiar to those of us with experience
in other web frameworks like Elixir's Phoenix, Ruby on Rails, or Python's
Django.

Mesa _aims_ to provides the best of both worlds: high developer productivity
and high application performance.
